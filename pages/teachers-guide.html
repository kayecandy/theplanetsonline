<h2>The Planets Online - Teacher's Guide</h2>
	<p>While this web site has been designed to allow the viewer to mix and match different commentaries and explore on their own, in a teaching context it’s helpful if everyone is seeing the same thing. This can be accomplished by specifying options at the end of the web address. </p>
	<p>For example, to send out a link to a class that shows the Music Composition commentary, you add “/?commentary=musiccomp” making the following address:  <a href="http://www.theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=musiccomp" target="_top">theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=musiccomp</a>.</p>
	<p>It’s possible to specify more than one commentary keyword, so if you wish students to see Music Composition and Music Performance, you would use a “+” sign, to make <a href="http://www.theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=musiccomp+musicperf" target="_top">theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=musiccomp+musicperf</a>. For a full list of commentaries see the table at the end of this page.</p>
	<p>Additionally, you can draw attention to particular sections by specifying a start time. The following link starts playing ten minutes in: <a href="http://www.theplanetsonline.com/?start=00:10:00" target="_top">theplanetsonline.com/?start=00:10:00</a>.</p>
	<p>And if you wished to hide the orchestra leaving just the visuals, you can do that too. The following enables the ‘Images only’ video: <a href="http://www.theplanetsonline.com/?video=1" target="_top">theplanetsonline.com/?video=1</a>. To enable the orchestra view use ‘video=0’.</p>
	<p>These various options can be combined if you separate them with an ‘&’ sign. Here’s an example: <a href="http://www.theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=trivia&video=1&start=00:10:00" target="_top">theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=trivia&video=1&start=00:10:00</a></p>
	<p>Would you like to write a commentary customized for your class? That’s easy. Just contact us for more details.</p>
