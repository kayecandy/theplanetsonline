<h3>A Note for Teachers</h3>
<p>This site can help students of all ages learn about a variety of subjects and includes features specifically for teachers. For example, you can send students special links that draw their attention to particular comments, images, and music selections. The following link shows web pages from NASA, so would be of interest to an astronomy class: <a href="http://www.theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=science-sources" target="_top">theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=science-sources</a>. And this next link would be suitable for a music class: <a href="http://www.theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=music" target="_top">theplanetsonline.com/?commentary=music</a>. For more details see the <a href="../pages/teachers-guide.html">Teacherâ€™s Guide</a>.</p>
